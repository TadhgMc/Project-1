# Project 1: Trippin' Around Columbus, OH

Working collaboratively with other developers is an important step in the full-stack journey. This group project includes team members Rebecca Diroll, Tadhg McIntyre, and Edita Pesa. 

With the use of server-side APIs OpenWeather and Ticketmaster, Git branching workflow, and agile software development we have created an application for users to utilize while planning a trip to Columbus, OH. They will be able to view the weather and look through local events occurring in specifically Columbus or Ohio.
